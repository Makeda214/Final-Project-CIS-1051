# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

#I would like to create a game that uses real data from arduino rodent activity detectors (RADs) in order to control a rat player character in a rat race game. The user could pick which rat they want to race with and the game will pick a winner based off of which one goes the farthest after determining which rat moved the most from the data. 

TODO

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

#Iplan to work by myself 

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?
#I am not sure what platform or coding language might be the best way to do this project. I am definitely open to any advice or suggestions.
