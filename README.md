# Final-Project-CIS-1051

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
#RAD Rat Race 

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#Using arduino Rodent Activity Detector data, the user can choose which rat they want to play with. A visual will run showing how much that rat runs around a track, and if your rat moved the most, it runs the furthest on the track and you win.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#I would like to use an arduino Rodent Activity Detector (RAD) to collect motion data. The game will display different rats and the user gets to choose their rat racer. Each rat racer will be matched to a random CSV file that has collected motion data. The more that rat moved, the farther the rat racer will run on a track. The object of the game is to pick a rat that goes the farthest. 

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

#This project does not overlap with another class, but it will overlap with my research lab. I am the primary lead of the RAD project, and we have many spare RADs. I will have to get permission to use real rat data, but if I cannot, I am able to simulate movement without rats in a way that will also collect data in a csv file. 

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

#I will not be collaborating with any other classmates for this project. 

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#No matter what, I would like to get the player characters matched to a randomized data set that will make the characters move more or less, and be able to compare them to declare a winner. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#A better outcome would be if I am able to create the visuals for the rats and make them unique. If I am able to, I would like to make these rats keep these characteristics as they move, and create a visual for the race track. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#The best outcome would be that I am able to get this game to fully work, and all visuals including rats and the racetrack are finished. I would like the user to be able to interact with this game to play it. I would like to be able to use real randomized data collected from rats and implement that into this project. 

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

#In order to accomplish all of this, first I have to find a platform that will allow me to build a rat race game that also allows me to import external data in the form of csv files. This project will give me a new perspective on data manipulation and formatting data for an entirely new purpose outside of typical research use. I have no real background in app/game development, so this will be a field that I need to research thoroughly in order achieve my goals for this project. I am not sure if python will be the best language to do this project in, so I will also have to research this.
